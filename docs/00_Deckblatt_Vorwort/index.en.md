# Preface

We, as Syncpoint <r>GmbH</r>, have set ourselves the goal of becoming an open-source alternative to industry-led, commercial command-and-control information systems. We believe that it is time for a paradigm shift.

Our experience in this field results from years of experience as a service provider for the Austrian Armed Forces in the co-development of the FüIS "PHÖNIX", as well as from the research project "INTERPRETER" (cooperation of civilian and military forces in case of disaster), in which we cooperated with renowned research institutions such as the Austrian Institute of Technology (AIT) and Joanneum Research.

Currently, we are also working in parallel on the research project "PIONEER" (digitalization of the reconnaissance process) together with the AIT and the BMLV, where we intend to use ODIN as a prototype for evaluation.

Due to the fact that many such systems are very complex and therefore for the operation of these systems the operators need time-consuming and costly training, as well as in case of prolonged "non-use" of the system, the operation can often no longer be ensured easily and frivolously, we have started to develop our own FüIS as of March 2020 (in lockdown).

We are aware that this is still a long way to go to reach our big goal. We are therefore continuously improving (basically with monthly updates) the capabilities of ODIN to meet the needs of operators and tacticians more and more.



**Basic data about ODIN**

- **Open source product** and therefore usable **free of charge** for everyone ("WITH license");
- Use of **various online maps** (incl. their "overlaid" display);
- user interface in **German** and **English**;
- **Symbols** according to **MIL-STD 2525C** (approx. 87% are currently implemented - without METOC area);
- executable for the operating systems **Windows**, **Linux** and **MacOS X**.
- **project** and **layermanagement** incl. export/import of data for external dispatch;
- **data** is **stored locally** (user is therefore "master of his data");
- and the most important is **easy to use**.



**"MIT-License "**

This means that anyone can use the software in any context. The source code may be changed arbitrarily and these changes do not have to be published. Even commercial use of ODIN by third parties is allowed.

The often cited "vendor lock-in" is also not an issue with ODIN.

However, the decision for open source is primarily a decision for maximum transparency for us. Our customers and partners can examine ODIN, explore possible areas of application and evaluate compatibility with existing infrastructure, and all this without having to buy a pig in a poke.



**Feedback**

To avoid implementing features or other useless "gimmicks" for the operators or tacticians we would appreciate your feedback on ODIN odin.syncpoint.io!
