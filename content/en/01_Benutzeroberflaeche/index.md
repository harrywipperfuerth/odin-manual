# **User Interface**



After starting ODIN for the first time, you will see the following user interface (by default it will open in English):

![](images/Benutzeroberflaeche_1.png)

- <span class="blue">1</span> map (Open Street Map) as central element of ODIN
- <span class="blue">2</span> current project name (in title bar)
- <span class="blue">3</span> menu bar
- <span class="blue">4</span> current project name (on the map)
- <span class="blue">5</span> active layer
- <span class="blue">6</span> activity bar
- <span class="blue">7</span> scale bar
- <span class="blue">8</span> current date (in NATO format)
- <span class="blue">9</span> coordinates display (related to the current position of the mouse pointer)
- <span class="blue">10</span> button to open the display of the currently used map



Below is an example with English user interface and with one layer:

Additionally (marked red) the following areas or functions are visible here:

- <span class="red">10</span> display of the currently used map (if button was opened)
- <span class="red">11</span> Activity Bar - e.g. here with opened area of the "Map Palette"
- <span class="red">12</span> actively selected (highlighted) feature on the map
- <span class="red">13</span> property window for the actively selected feature
- <span class="red">14</span> not actively selected features are displayed "faded out" on the map



In **further sequence** the **description** of the individual areas, functionalities etc. with the **English user interface**!

In order to keep the **user manual slim** or to **restrict** it to the **most useful areas, **functions** etc., **self-explanatory functions** (e.g. quit ODIN, minimize/maximize etc.) **are not explained** **separately** in this user manual**!
